### Chemical model

	- Support open source software COPASI, and SBML format
	- Describe the complex molecular pathes behind synaptic plasticity

### Electrial model

	- Run with open source software NEURON
	- Describe the electrial properties of MVN Type B neurons



## Figures 

In the figures folder, we include all the necessary files, scripts, and guides to reproduce all the figures in our paper.
