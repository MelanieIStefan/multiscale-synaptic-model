# multiscale-synaptic-plasticity-model


## Model

In the model folder, the two models - chemical model of synaptic plasticity, and electraical model of MVN Type B neurons are included. 




### Chemical model

	- Support open source software COPASI (http://copasi.org), and SBML format
	- Describe the complex molecular pathes behind synaptic plasticity

### Electrial model

	- Run with open source software NEURON (https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/)
	- Describe the electrial properties of MVN Type B neurons



## Figures 

In the figures folder, we include all the necessary files, scripts, and guides to reproduce all the figures in our paper.
