## Components

- **\*\*.hoc**
	- NEURON protocol scripts to generate NEURON simulation results.
	- run\_Normal\_scanAmp\_Jan.hoc is for Figure 8
	- run\_Normal\_scanDur\_H\_Jan.hoc is for Figure 9
	- run\_Normal\_scanTim\_Jan.hoc is for Figure 10
- **SetupFolders.py**
	- run the script on the local machine in the directory containing NEURON input files and 
	the intial COPASI modelï¼Œ the script loops through both the COPASI model and NEURON input files generating new models in seperate folders
	- SetupFolders_strength_duration.py is for strength and duration, where the unit stimulation windows is 1000 ms. 
	- SetupFolders_timing.py is for timing simulation, where the unit stimulation time windows is 1500 ms.

-  **allruns.sh**  
	- The script automatically submits all the COPASI models to the queue on the  computer cluster 
	- Run the script in the directory containing folders with the COPASI models

- **\*\*\_extract_batch_info.py**
	- To visulize the results from the batch COPASI runs.

- **command_generator.py \*\*\_commands.txt**
	- command_generator.py generates \*\*\_commands.txt, which include the COPASI file to be run.

- **threading.sh**
	- Bash script to run multi COPASI file in parallel. Change the command file name in line 18 to decide which \*\*\_commands.txt to run.




## Instruction 
	- Copy the NEURON protocol script into the NEURON folder (model/electrical/MVNmodel)
	- Run the NEURON protocol script to generate corresponding NEURON output that recording membrane potential and calcium concentration in MVN neurons.
	- Copy the initial COPASI model () into the result folder of from previous NEURON model, which is in biochemistry equilibrium under normal firing MVN B neurons condition.
	- Copy the SetupFolders.py to the previous dolder and run the scritp (`python SetupFolders.py `) to generate new COPASI file with controled calcium concentration from NEURON output.
	- Run allruns.sh (if in cluster) or run command_generator.py and hreading.sh (if in a multi-core computer) to run all the COPASI model and outputs will be automatically recorded.
	- Run \*\*_extract_batch_info to plot the recorded biochemistry dynamics under certain electrial simulation.
